# HRAttrition-Project
Attrition is something employers try to combat every year. Surveys and demographics are great ways to get to the heart of what employees care about. In this project, we dive into identifying which features directly lead to attrition and create actionable metrics to reduce attrition within the company.

### Final Project ###
Read my Kaggle Notebook [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/marissan/hr-attrition-project)

### Programs Used ###
- Juypter Notebook Python

### Scope of Work ###
**Deliverables** <br>
- A list of metrics that have the biggest impact on attrition
- 1 Baseline model
- 2 Predictive Models
  - Logistical Regression
  - Random Forest
- EDA with various visualizations showing the results of the survey

### Goals ###
This was for my DAT 430 Project. This class had very little hand holding and was rather open-ended on the details of this project. I was pretty unfamiliar besides 1 statistics class on how to use predictive models and implement them effectively. I was hoping this project would clear some of that confusion up. 

### Data Source ###
This data set was provided from my institution though there is a remarkably similar one on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) that is fictional made by IBM scientists. 

### Reflection ###
I really learned a lot in this project! I got a lot more confident using Kaggle Notebooks, implementing markdown (which is very similar to what I'm writing this in!) instead of using code comments, and throughoughly expanding my Python machine learning experience. I became much more aware of how to encode integer and cateogrical variables for predictive analysis and I felt like I communicated that well in my notebook. I got better at tuning my code and understanding package implementation. I actually learned what a baseline model after I already developed my first logistical regression model (which I thought was my baseline!). It was really cool implementing a lot of my previous coursework knowledge into this "magnum opus" of sorts to really leverage data in a way that would have real world implications some day. The concept of employee engagement is close to my heart as someone 8 years deep in a supply chain setting. I've seen the trends and shifts within myself as an employee and how it relates to some of the features within this data set. Whenever I have discussions with those outside my field, I always used to tell them that my career will revolve around taking things like "employee engagement surveys" and translating them into actionable insights, and here was a really close to real life verison of that!! This project definitely inspired me to tackle more machine learning and really put myself out there and weild predictive modeling as effectively proof that I'm not just creating averages and calling it a day. I'm very proud of my work here.
